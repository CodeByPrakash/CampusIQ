## 🔄 Continuous Learning & Anomaly Retraining

Traditional ML models fail on facility telemetry due to class imbalance (anomalies represent <3% of data) and seasonal drift. CampusIQ implements an **Active Anomaly Feedback Engine**:

1. **Feedback Ingestion**: Facility operators flag false alarms or confirm true anomalies via `POST /api/v1/continuous-learning/feedback`.
2. **Anomaly Buffer & Weighting**: Confirmed anomalies are preserved in an active buffer and assigned higher sample loss weights.
3. **Progressive Retraining**: Triggers retraining without forgetting historical baselines (`POST /api/v1/continuous-learning/retrain`).
4. **Evaluation Beyond Accuracy**: Models are evaluated and tuned on:
   - **Precision**: Minimizing false alerts.
   - **Recall**: Catching critical failures.
   - **F1-Score**: Balancing alert quality.
   - **Anomaly Coverage Rate**: Percentage of high-impact anomalies identified before breakdown.

## 📈 Synthetic IoT Data Generation

Located in [`ML/data/generators/`](file:///c:/Users/absol/Desktop/BPUT_Hackathon/ML/data/generators/):
- **Energy Data**: Incorporates diurnal peak/off-peak patterns, weekday/weekend schedules, seasonal AC thermal load variations, and injected spike/drop anomalies.
- **Water Data**: Models morning/evening usage peaks, night baseline flow, and synthetic pipe bursts and micro-leaks.
- **Waste Data**: Simulates bin fill trajectories, cafeteria mealtime surges, collection cycles, and missed collection events.
- **Air Quality Data**: Generates PM2.5, PM10, $NO_2$, $SO_2$, $CO$, and $O_3$ aligned with Indian NAQI breakpoints and wind dispersion.
- **Asset Telemetry**: Simulates degradation curves, vibration increases, and thermal drift across 124+ facility assets.
- **Safety Incidents**: Models Poisson arrival rates, zone-specific distributions, and emergency response times.
